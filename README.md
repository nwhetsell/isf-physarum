This is an [ISF shader](https://isf.video) for simulating the slime mold
_Physarum polycephalum_. The simulation is based “Characteristics of pattern
formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks” by
Jeff Jones (PDF available [here](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579)),
and [this webpage by Sage Johnson](https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum)
is another excellent resource. This particular shader is converted from
[this ShaderToy shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tlKGDh) by
[**@MichaelMoroz**](https://github.com/MichaelMoroz).
